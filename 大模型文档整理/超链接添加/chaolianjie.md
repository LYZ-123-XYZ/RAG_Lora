Companies are rushing to deploy generative AI into their internal workflows or customer-facing applications because they recognize the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing various facets of their operations. Generative AI, exemplified by technologies like GPT-3, has demonstrated its capacity to streamline processes, improve customer interactions, and generate innovative solutions. The success of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other similar models has sparked a fervor among businesses to leverage AI for enhancing efficiency, delivering personalized experiences, and gaining a competitive edge in their respective industries. As a result, they are investing resources in training AI models and integrating generative AI into their workflows to capitalize on the myriad benefits it offers.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and

OpenAI faces challenges in deploying its multi-modal models due to GPU shortages. The demand for GPUs has surged, creating obstacles for OpenAI to access the necessary hardware resources to deploy these advanced models. Additionally, longer sequence length models, such as 8k versus 32k, also face deployment constraints due to the scarcity of GPUs. This shortage has led to difficulties in advancing OpenAI's multi-modal models for practical use.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and
------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese companies have been actively investing in the deployment of their own Language Model Models (LLMs) and are stockpiling GPUs in anticipation of potential further export controls from the US. For instance, Bytedance, the company behind TikTok, has reportedly ordered over $1 billion worth of A800/H800s from Nvidia. This strategic move by Chinese companies has contributed to the strain on GPU availability, further exacerbating the shortage and impacting organizations like OpenAI seeking access to these resources.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and
------------------------------------------------------------
The surge in GPU demand is attributed to both legitimate and speculative factors. While there are many legitimate use cases for large-scale GPU deployment in AI, there is also a notable trend of individuals and organizations rushing to purchase GPUs without a clear, proven market need. Additionally, big tech firms are striving to keep pace with OpenAI and Google, driving up the demand for GPUs as they seek to avoid falling behind in the advancement of AI technologies. Furthermore, a significant influx of venture capital funding is being directed towards startups with unverified business use cases, compounding the demand for GPUs without concrete market validation.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and

The production and supply of high-end Nvidia GPUs, particularly the H100, are facing significant challenges. Despite Nvidia's efforts to increase production, the highest-end Nvidia GPU, H100, is expected to remain sold out until Q1 of next year. Nvidia is aiming to ramp up the shipment of more than 400,000 H100 GPUs per quarter to meet the demand. The scarcity of these GPUs has led to competition among enterprises and even nation states, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, attempting to acquire hundreds of millions of dollars of GPUs.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and
------------------------------------------------------------
There are several bottlenecks affecting the production of high-end GPUs, including the H 100. These bottlenecks are likely attributed to the complex manufacturing process and the high demand for advanced GPUs. Despite these challenges, Nvidia and its competitors are working to expand downstream capacity to address the supply constraints. It's crucial for them to overcome the production bottlenecks and increase the supply of GPUs to meet the growing market demand.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and

Certainly. The Nvidia H100 GPU is 7-die packaged on CoWoS-S. The H100 GPU ASIC, which is the core component of this high-end GPU, has a sizable die size of 814mm 2. This indicates its advanced and complex architecture, showcasing Nvidia's cutting-edge technology in the high-performance computing and graphics processing domain. The remarkable specifications of the H100 GPU make it a highly sought-after product, contributing to the challenges in its production and supply.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and
------------------------------------------------------------
The scarcity of high-end GPUs, including the H100, has led to a competitive landscape where numerous enterprises and even nation states are striving to secure these valuable components. Notably, we know of over a dozen enterprises that are endeavoring to train their own LLM on their own data, emphasizing the critical need for high-performance GPUs in various domains. It's also worth mentioning that nation states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are making significant investments to acquire these GPUs, reflecting the widespread impact of the supply challenges in the market.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and

What are the drawbacks of using "TSMC"s SoIC for HBM packaging?
------------------------------
Answer： SoIC, while enabling stacking dies directly on top of logic, does not align with the specific requirements of HBM. SoIC offers a different order of magnitude regarding interconnect density and is more suitable for expanding on-chip cache with die stacking, as evidenced by AMD's 3D V-Cache solution. Therefore, for HBM systems, CoWoS remains the preferred advanced packaging technology due to its compatibility with the high demands of HBM technology and its cost-effectiveness.https://www.semianalysis.com/p/ai-capacity-constraints-cowos-and
