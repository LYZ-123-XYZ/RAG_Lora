CoWoS is a \" 2.5D\" packaging technology provided by TSMC. It involves integrating multiple active silicon dies, typically logic and HBM stacks, on a passive silicon interposer which acts as a communication layer for the active die on top. The interposer and active silicon are then attached to a packaging substrate that contains the I/O to be placed on the system PCB. HBM and CoWoS are considered complementary technologies, and the capacity for CoWoS is now becoming a crucial concern in the industry.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/AI_Capacity_Constraints.pdf"}

The high pad count and short trace length requirements of HBM make it necessary to utilize advanced packaging technologies like CoWoS to enable dense, short connections that cannot be achieved on a PCB or package substrate. As almost all HBM systems are currently packaged on CoWoS and advanced AI accelerators use HBM, it has become the go-to technology for leading-edge data center GPUs, particularly those produced by TSMC.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/AI_Capacity_Constraints.pdf"}

In this approach, each GPU is responsible for processing a specific subset of the layers in the model. Each GPU performs the computations for its designated layers and then passes the output to the next GPU in the pipeline. This way, the memory required for each GPU is reduced since they only need to store the intermediate results of their assigned layers. The purpose of pipeline parallelism is to enable the training of larger models that wouldn't fit in the memory of a single GPU. It allows for efficient utilization of resources and facilitates training on systems with limited memory capacity.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/H100_Clusters_Power.pdf"}

Therefore, when frontend networks are utilized during training, network topology aware global all-reduce between islands must be done. First, each pod or island will perform a local reduce-scatter within the pod InfiniBand or ICI networking, leaving each GPU/TPU having the sum for a subsection of the gradient.

However, datacenters generally have constant power usage 24x7, while solar power does not generate constant power throughout the day. Therefore, it is challenging to rely solely on solar power to meet the energy needs of datacenters. Additionally, space constraints and development planning make it difficult to build renewable plants on-site to directly power datacenters. Wind and hydro power can be alternative options, but again, they also have limitations in providing constant power. To address this issue, companies often procure renewable energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), where the renewable energy project sells its power into the grid, and the datacenter purchases its needs from the grid. This allows companies to support renewable energy but does not guarantee that the datacenter is solely using renewable energy. Consequently, datacenters still rely on a mix of other fuels such as coal and natural gas, resulting in carbon emissions. Even if datacenters contribute renewable energy to the grid, they still increase the need for fossil fuel power generation during low renewable energy generation periods. This conundrum acknowledges the challenge of achieving 100% renewable energy consumption for datacenters. However, companies like Microsoft have committed to a long-term vision of sourcing 100% of their electricity consumption from zero-carbon sources.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/AI_Datacenter_Energy_Dilemma.pdf"}

This design, similar to the chiplet interconnect in AMD's Navi31 gaming GPU, includes both horizontal and vertical links with symmetrical read/write bandwidth. Additionally, the square topology of the AIDs means that diagonal connections require 2 hops compared to 1 hop for adjacent AIDs. Depending on the MI300 variant, 2 or 4 of these AIDs with varying compute capabilities are grouped together on top of a CoWoS silicon interposer.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/AMD_MI300_Taming_The_Hype.pdf"}

Half-field stitching is a challenge because lithography scanners expose wafers through an exposure slit and move the wafer under the slit to expose a pattern from the photomask onto the wafer. With half-field stitching, the scanner steps over to a fresh area of the wafer and repeats the scan, resulting in stitching errors. Depth of focus and photoresist are challenges because increasing the NA of the scanner means that the depth of focus decreases, making it harder to focus, and the photoresist becomes more sensitive, making it more challenging to achieve the right contrast.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

With the exposure field size for high-NA scanners being only half that of low-NA EUV and traditional DUV tools, the necessity of mixing half- and full-field exposures on the same wafer becomes an issue. This tradeoff requires chip designers to plan mask layouts and chip dimensions with both half-field and full-field imaging in mind, which can lead to high costs despite small die sizes if not optimized properly. Additionally, the use of high-NA scanners only on specific critical layers further complicates the design process, as cheaper tools with relaxed imaging capabilities will be used for other layers, introducing additional complexity to chip designs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

This results in a significant reduction in dose which allows the scanner to be used to its full potential, with throughput being limited by the speed of the wafer and mask stages rather than the dose. Additionally, despite requiring twice as many wafer passes through the scanner, the lithography costs are lower than a high-NA single exposure due to the strong throughput advantage of low-NA double patterning.  Furthermore, the cost advantage of low-NA double patterning increases as the CD shrinks, even between the 2 and  1.4nm nodes, and the faster stages developed for high-NA will be backported to future low-NA models, further improving their cost advantage over high-NA. It's important to consider the potential effects if source power cannot be increased up to 1kW, which could lead to a significant increase in lithography costs at future nodes. However, advancements in source power have been observed in each new EUV scanner model.  Overall, the advantage of low-NA double patterning lies in its ability to achieve lower dose requirements, maximize scanner potential, and ultimately lower lithography costs compared to high-NA single exposure techniques. These conclusions are supported by public materials from ASML.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

High-NA scanners were assumed to have a cost advantage over low-NA double patterning in 2020, but from 2021 onwards, the metric of choice changes from cost per wafer to process complexity. Chipmakers running 1000+ step wafer fabrication processes are used to complexity. They plan fabs and purchase equipment based on cost and projected yield, of which low-NA seems to perform better on. However, at the 1nm and 7A nodes, now in the 2030+ timeframe, the cost gap finally closes. Driving this is the paradigm change from geometry scaling to stacking – rather than shrinking features horizontally, chip performance power and area improvements are achieved by stacking features vertically. High-NA insertion is seen as the natural place for this change from 2d scaling to 3d scaling, and it changes the litho-intensity of advanced logic manufacturing heavily. Therefore, chipmakers have purchased at least 10 orders for high-NA systems for their future production needs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

That proof will come next year when the first High-NA EUV tool starts being tested. As far as overlay challenges, it appears that low-NA EUV will still have better fidelity even with LELE schemes, let alone self-aligned schemes. Our analysis shows high-NA reaches cost parity & use in high-volume wafer manufacturing at the 1nm node, in 2030 or  31. This is 1 or 2 nodes and as many as 5 years later than publicly forecast by ASML.

The public financial model of ASML which drives their huge valuation premium, is at risk as High-NA tool orders will not come in the quantities that are required to hit the 2028 shipment targets. However, keep in mind that the alternative to high-NA scanners is just a higher number of low-NA scanners, of which ASML is still the sole supplier.

Chiplets similar to this are pervasive in modern multi-chip module designs, such as AMD’s MI 300. In a case like this where the die dimensions are non-optimal, the lithography costs of combining half- and full-field exposures are higher than using only full-field. One option is to layout as many die as possible on the full field mask, here more than 90% of the mask is utilized. The corresponding high-NA, half field mask unfortunately has poor utilization and requires the scanner to image 3 high-NA fields for every full field exposure. Imaging a higher number of fields (the nominal case is 2 half-fields to match a single full field) means more time wasted stepping between them.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

One significant challenge is the increased generation of particles from the high number of mask swaps. The mechanical process of unloading one mask and clamping another during mask swaps runs the risk of generating particles. Even a single foreign particle on the mask can substantially impact yield as it affects the image printed on every die imaged. Moreover, in legacy processes, masks are typically swapped much less often, with each lot of 25 wafers or even less frequently, thus highlighting the potential for increased particle generation with field stitching. Furthermore, accurate placement of metrology targets in the active area of the chip is essential to assist with field stitching, requiring high precision in aligning the 2 fields to create functional features that cross between them. These challenges underscore the complexity and meticulous attention to detail required when implementing field stitching in chip manufacturing.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

Furthermore, the Armv9 instruction set and A510 cores utilized by Arm are from their Cambridge headquarters. The A510 cores are specifically designed at Arm's Sophia France R&D center and Cambridge. The chip showcases remarkable technical capabilities, demonstrating performance and power efficiency comparable to Qualcomm chips that are one to two years old, such as the S888 and S8G1 models. Particularly, the RF aspect of the chip stands out, featuring an integrated modem that rivals Qualcomm's latest offerings. This level of technological prowess is not unexpected considering Huawei's previous lead over Qualcomm before facing restrictions from using TSMC. Notably, the RF Front End chips are domestically produced, challenging the perception that such capabilities were lacking in China. Surprisingly, direct comparisons between Arm's A510 for Huawei's Kirin 9000S, built on SMIC's N+2 (7nm) process, and the 2022 Qualcomm S8G1, built on Samsung's 4LPX process, revealed that the performance and power efficiency of the Arm A510 cores are comparable despite the process technology gap. This indicates that SMIC N+2 is more advanced than commonly recognized in the West. One contributing factor to the comparable performance of these chips is Samsung's low yield and SMIC's high yield. In essence, the Kirin 9000S chip is a more sophisticated design than many in the Western market may realize.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/China_AI_Semiconductors_Rise_US_Sanctions_Have_Failed.pdf"}

While the parametric yield remains a critical and somewhat unknown metric, the observed decent yield is a positive indicator of the technology's development. The cleanliness of the channels, gates, drains on the FinFETs, as well as the contacts and lower metal layers further reinforce the notion of a well-performing process. A process with low yield typically exhibits inconsistencies and lacks uniformity, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Additionally, the apparent binning of the chip is another clue to the technology's strength. \"Binning\" involves categorizing integrated circuits based on their performance and quality after manufacturing and testing. If a process technology has low parametric yield, adjustments can be made in the binning process to enhance the overall performance.

In many cases, even though a chip may not have catastrophic defects, it can still exhibit variations in performance and power consumption. This factor is known as parametric yield. By categorizing chips through binning, semiconductor manufacturers can optimize the use of chips with varying performance levels. In scenarios where a process technology has lower parametric yield, adjustments in the binning process can be made to enhance overall chip performance.

A trillion-parameter dense model, for example, cannot reach the necessary throughput on even the newest Nvidia H100 GPU servers because every generated token requires loading every parameter onto the chip from memory. This process, along with additional bandwidth needed for the attention mechanism's KV cache, creates inefficiencies that significantly limit the model's speed. Even with optimized libraries like Nvidia's FasterTransformer, the total overhead surpasses expectations. The reality is that even 8xH100 servers struggle to serve a 1 trillion parameter dense model at  33.33 tokens per second, with low FLOPS utilization rates resulting in high inference costs. The inference constraint for an 8-way tensor parallel H100 system hovers around ~300 billion feed-forward parameters.

For example, MoE is incredibly difficult to deal with on inference because not every part of the model is utilized on every token generation.

Another tradeoff is that researchers have shown that using 64 to 128 experts achieves better loss than 16 experts, but that’s purely research.

In simplified terms, each parameter in the model must be read, with 2 Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) associated with it. The imbalance in the ratio of memory bandwidth to FLOPS in many chips, such as the H100 SXM, can pose challenges for inference at batch size  1. When serving only one user at batch size 1, the memory bandwidth needed to stream in every parameter for every token generation dominates the inference time, while the compute time is minimal.  To efficiently scale a large language model for multiple users, the batch size needs to exceed 1 to amortize the parameter read cost. For instance, at batch sizes of 256 or 512, there are 512 FLOP/s or 1024 FLOP/s for each byte of memory read in. This adjusted ratio more closely aligns with the memory bandwidth versus FLOPS of chips like the H100, enabling better performance and scalability for serving multiple users simultaneously.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

While many attribute memory capacity as a bottleneck for Large Language Model (LLM) inference, the need for multiple chips to accommodate large models is often overlooked. Despite the requirement of higher memory capacity for larger models, using more chips than necessary can help mitigate latency, increase throughput, and allow for larger batch sizes, resulting in higher utilization rates. These tradeoffs were demonstrated by Google in their PaLM inference paper, although it's important to note that this was specific to a dense model like PaLM and not a sparse model like GPT- 4. In scenarios where minimal latency is crucial, deploying more chips and strategically partitioning the model is essential. On the other hand, for applications prioritizing offline inference with no latency constraints, the focus shifts to maximizing per-chip throughput by increasing batch sizes. However, this introduces the challenge of networking time when using more chips and higher batch sizes. Additionally, memory requirements for the KV cache increase significantly with larger batch sizes and sequence lengths, impacting inference time. Notably, longer sequence lengths pose challenges related to memory bandwidth and capacity, resulting in constraints on batch sizes due to memory limitations.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

This is because with larger sequence lengths, the KV cache expands, increasing the need for individual memory reads as the KV cache cannot be shared between users. As a result, memory bandwidth becomes further bottlenecked, impacting throughput, latency, and utilization at higher batch sizes. In the case of GPT-4's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where each token generation forward pass can be routed to a different set of experts, having 16 experts with 2 routed per forward pass introduces complexities. For instance, with a batch size of 8, the parameter read for each expert could vary significantly, potentially leading to uneven distribution among experts in terms of batch sizes. This dynamic routing algorithm results in significant variation in token-to-token latency and expert batch sizes, posing challenges in optimizing inference performance. OpenAI opted for a smaller number of experts in GPT-4 to balance the trade-offs and avoid further exacerbating memory bandwidth bottlenecks during inference.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

The second phase is decoding, where a token is chosen from the generated logits and fed back into the model to produce logits for the next token. This process continues iteratively until the desired number of tokens is generated. However, decoding sequentially can be computationally expensive because weights must be streamed through the compute units each time to generate a single token, resulting in low arithmetic intensity when operating in small batches.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

If the draft model's predictions align with those of the larger model, several tokens can be decoded using a single batch, thereby saving significant memory bandwidth and time per token. However, if the larger model disagrees with the tokens predicted by the draft model, the remaining batch is discarded, and the algorithm reverts to the standard token-by-token decoding approach.

While FLOPS have increased drastically thanks to Moore's Law, memory development has not kept pace. For instance, in 2018, when the BERT model was cutting-edge and the Nvidia V100 GPU was top-tier, matrix multiplication was no longer the main factor for enhancing model performance. Today's advanced models have grown exponentially in parameter count, and the fastest GPUs have seen a substantial increase in FLOPS.

This highlights the importance of memory in the overall performance of these models. Architects are faced with the challenge of optimizing memory hierarchies, from fast and close memory pools like SRAM on the same chip to slower and more cost-effective options further away. While some machine-learning ASICs aim to leverage large pools of SRAM for holding model weights, there are inherent limitations and drawbacks to this approach.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/How_Nvidia%E2%80%99s_CUDA_Monopoly_In_Machine_Learning_Is_Breaking.pdf"}

Even a particle as small as 1 micron in height can result in a bond void of 10 millimeters in diameter, which would lead to a defective bond. Unlike bump-based interconnects that have gaps between the device and substrate, hybrid bonding involves bonding two very smooth and planar surfaces flush together, making it highly susceptible to particles. Due to the mechanical nature of hybrid bonding, which involves picking up and placing dies on top of each other, particles from various sources such as wafer dicing, grinding, polishing, and friction can easily contaminate the bonding interface. Ensuring cleanliness is crucial in hybrid bonding to avoid yield impacts, but complete elimination of particles is challenging. While regular wafer cleaning is performed, it is not always 100% effective in removing contaminants in a single pass. Hence, advanced cleanrooms with stringent cleanliness requirements, such as class 1 / ISO 3 clean rooms or better, are essential for hybrid bonding processes. Companies like TSMC and Intel even go as far as using ISO 2 or ISO 1 class clean rooms to ensure the highest quality and yield in their hybrid bonding processes.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

As a result, most OSATs would need to build newer and more advanced cleanrooms to be involved in hybrid bonding, while firms like TSMC and Intel can use their existing fabs. Additionally, the process flow of hybrid bonding involves many tools that have traditionally only been used exclusively by fabs, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), etch, physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrochemical deposition (ECD), chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP), and surface preparation/activation. Therefore, outsourced assembly and test firms (OSAT) such as ASE and Amkor have relatively little experience with these tools and processes. The combination of cleanliness required and increase in tools contributes to a huge cost increase, making the process of hybrid bonding relatively expensive compared to other forms of packaging.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

The surface roughness threshold is generally said to be  0.5nm for the dielectric and 1nm for the copper pads. To achieve this level of smoothness, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is performed and is a highly critical process for hybrid bonding. After polishing, this smoothness needs to be maintained all the way through the flow, and steps that could damage this surface, such as harsh cleaning, are avoided.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

Wafer-to-wafer (W2W) process involves bonding two fabricated wafers directly together, offering higher alignment accuracy, throughput, and bond yields. On the other hand, in Die-to-Wafer (D2W) process, individual dies are bonded to a wafer. Currently, the majority of hybrid bonding is done via W2W due to its relative ease and advantages. The higher bond yield in W2W is attributed to the separation of alignment and bonding steps. In W2W tools, a separate chamber performs the alignment before the wafers are moved into the bonding chamber, which is in a vacuum, for the actual bonding process. Additionally, W2W is a cleaner process with fewer steps, allowing for the cleaning of wafers before alignment and bonding, and reducing the potential for contamination. Furthermore, the die singulation, which can be a source of particle contamination, occurs only after the bond in the W2W process, contributing to its higher bond yield. Moreover, the longer alignment time for W2W, being a wafer-level process, does not significantly impact throughput as it would in a chip-level process.

This two-step bonding process separates the alignment and actual bonding, allowing for a cleaning step to remove any accumulated contaminants before the final pre-bond. However, this method introduces additional steps and the risk of alignment errors, especially with the additional wafer-to-wafer (W2W) bond step. In the TSMC SOIC, this process involves 5 bond steps for each AMD 3D V-cache chip - from the bottom CPU die to the carrier, 3D V-cache chiplet to the carrier, and 2x dummy silicon to the carrier.

This method is considered less mature compared to other bonding techniques. However, it is believed that going forward, direct D2W bonding will be used more due to its process simplification benefits. One advantage of collective D2W bonding is that cleaning can be performed, and then the chips can be directly sent into the alignment chamber to reduce contamination. Although D2W cluster tools are now being introduced to recreate this flow, reducing the benefits of the collective process, direct D2W bonding is still preferred for finer pad pitches as alignment becomes more challenging. Eliminating the W2W bonding step helps in reducing the risk of misalignment during the process.

This was followed by Perplexity at $ 0.14 input / $ 0.56 output, then Anyscale at $ 0.50 output, and finally Deepinfra at $ 0.27 output. However, the game changed when OpenRouter entered the scene offering token output for free. It's important to note that the presented tokens per second numbers by these companies are unachievable and come with stringent rate limits that hinder testing. Currently, all these inference offerings are operating at a loss. It's worth mentioning that the 2x H100 may not be the most cost-effective system for the Mixtral model; the 2x A100 80GB, with approximately 32% higher bandwidth per dollar, is a better option assuming a similar memory bandwidth utilization rate. Despite the lower FLOPS of the A100, it doesn't significantly impact inference performance. However, even with the collapsed pricing levels, there's practically no scenario where even 2xA100s can generate profits. Furthermore, the report will highlight the advantages brought by H200 and MI300X for inference tasks. The Mixtral model, being a mixture of experts model, behaves differently as batch size increases. At batch size 1, only a fraction of the parameters activate per forward pass, enhancing the model's capabilities with lower bandwidth and FLOPS per token. This scenario works best with batch size 1 and sufficient memory capacity to accommodate the model. With larger batch sizes, more model experts are activated, leading to the reading of all model parameters for each forward pass across all experts, while each decode token still passes through only two experts.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Inference_Race_To_The_Bottom.pdf"}

It has been observed that techniques such as CFET, 3D stacking, and backside power delivery can exacerbate thermal issues, potentially leading to performance decreases. For instance, AMD's simulations suggest up to a 5% performance decrease when using backside power delivery due to the need for throttling to prevent overheating. This is attributed to the wafer thinning and bonding process required for fabricating backside devices, which reduces the thermal conductivity of the silicon near the devices, hindering effective heat dissipation. Similarly, 3D packaging may encounter performance loss of up to 5% due to throttling at hot spots, especially in cases where bulk wafer thinning is necessary.

TSMC showcased two approaches to dealing with increased power densities. The first method involves placing dummy copper thermal vias, which act as \"heat pipes\" to conduct heat away from the hotspots. While this showed excellent thermal performance, the electrical performance was negatively affected due to the conductivity of copper.   A more promising approach was the use of thermally conductive layers between bonded wafers. By replacing the SiO2 bond with an inter-layer dielectric (ILD) with high thermal conductivity, thermal performance was improved without the adverse electrical effects. TSMC demonstrated the use of materials such as AlN and diamond, produced to a sub-micron thickness with high enough thermal conductivity to be viable.

The critical dimension refers to the smallest line or space width that a lithography scanner can image. Balancing CD requirements with the necessary dose for accurate imaging poses a significant challenge in high-NA technology, affecting overall production costs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Intel%E2%80%99s_14A_Magic_Bullet_Directed_Self-Assembly%20(DSA).pdf"}

This means the scanner must run more slowly to wait for enough photons to reach each exposure field. Running slowly leads to fewer wafers produced by the scanner, resulting in a significant cost increase, especially for a tool depreciating by more than $150,000 per day. Lower exposure doses can allow the scanner to run close to its maximum throughput, but this would normally result in poor image quality. However, with Directed Self Assembly (DSA), this issue can be rectified. DSA is a nanopatterning technique that utilizes the self-organizing properties of block copolymers, guided by pre-patterned templates. In simple terms, DSA can repair features, reduce the required dose, and improve the final pattern quality.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Intel%E2%80%99s_14A_Magic_Bullet_Directed_Self-Assembly%20(DSA).pdf"}

These two polymers do not mix well, similar to oil and water, due to their differing polarities. When heated, the BCP's molecules quickly arrange themselves into a regular pattern of layers, with each polymer forming alternating lines. This process occurs by adding energy in the form of heat, allowing the molecules to find equilibrium. The result is a regular pattern of PS and PMMA alternating lines, each approximately 20nm wide.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Intel%E2%80%99s_14A_Magic_Bullet_Directed_Self-Assembly%20(DSA).pdf"}

DSA was initially considered as a potential technology for extending Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography when Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) was not yet feasible about 10-15 years ago. However, at that time, multi-patterning emerged as the favored approach, followed by the eventual readiness of EUV for high-volume production, leading to DSA being sidelined. As a result, DSA has been limited to niche applications, primarily in the production of image sensors by Sony. Additionally, the specificity of the pitch in DSA necessitates different formulations for each, posing a challenge for fabrication facilities. Notably, the limitations of the DSA process, which is typically geared towards 1D line/space patterns or contact hole arrays and is inherently restricted to a single pitch per layer, have further contributed to the protracted research phase for Intel.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Intel%E2%80%99s_14A_Magic_Bullet_Directed_Self-Assembly%20(DSA).pdf"}

Block copolymers, DSA, and specifically PS-b-PMMA are not new, but only EMD Electronics has publicly demonstrated the required level of process control and a plan for HVM. For equipment vendors, it is a similar story to Applied Material’s Sculpta directional etch which has the potential to substantially reduce EUV layers reducing the need for multi-patterning. However, in the short term, both Sculpta and DSA are being marketed and implemented as “complimentary” to rather than “replacing” EUV. To be clear, when implemented, they do reduce spend that would go to lithography equipment. While DSA may reduce EUV multi-patterning, ASML still stands to benefit as it makes the economics of their ultra-expensive high-NA scanner much more palatable. TEL also has upside here as the DSA chemicals are spun-on and baked in the TEL track. Lam Research could also benefit because removing polar PMMA molecules requires dry etch, although TEL is trying to compete there too. Intel, while certainly the most public about its results, is not the only chipmaker working seriously on DSA.

After adding in an implicit leading 1 to each mantissa, the mantissas are added together to form the output mantissa. If there is an overflow, the result exponent is increased by 1 and the mantissa is shifted downward. If the result is negative, it is converted back to an unsigned mantissa and the output sign is set to be negative. The mantissa is then normalized so that it has the leading 1 and the implicit leading 1 is removed. Lastly, the mantissa is rounded appropriately, usually to round-to-nearest-even.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Neural_Network_Quantization%26Number_Formats_From_First_Principles.pdf"}

One such approach is the Log Number System, which has been highlighted by Nvidia as a potential pathway to continue scaling beyond 8-bit number formats. The Log Number System generally results in smaller errors from rounding; however, challenges such as the costly adders it requires can be encountered. Additionally, formats like NF4 and its variants, such as AF4, have been developed as 4-bit formats that utilize an exact lookup table to minimize rounding errors, assuming weights follow a perfect normal distribution. Nevertheless, these methods may pose challenges in terms of area and power efficiency, as each operation necessitates a lookup into a substantial table of entries.

It is essential for accumulation to be in higher precision than FP8 to prevent rounding down to zero during sequential small updates. Additionally, each FP8 weight tensor is associated with a scale factor to adjust the range of values, as different layers may have significantly varying ranges. The weight update process outside the main computation box is sensitive to precision and generally requires a higher precision level (typically FP32) due to the magnitude mismatch between weight updates and the weights themselves.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Neural_Network_Quantization%26Number_Formats_From_First_Principles.pdf"}

On the other hand, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Microsoft, Meta, Arm, and Qualcomm are concentrating on the Microscaling (MX) format, with customizable block sizes and data types. MX formats provide more range than FP16, with MXINT8 offering superior accuracy and range compared to FP16 while using fewer bits to represent at block sizes of 32 or  64. MXFP4 is particularly suited for inference tasks, favored by companies like Arm and Qualcomm. Microsoft, a key player in research and standardization of these formats, surprisingly does not support MXINT8, focusing instead on MXFP4, FXFP6, and MXFP 8.

This alignment ensures that the data can be transferred effectively without loss or truncation. However, when DRAM transfers occur in increments of 16 or 32 but require a block transfer of 32 or 64 microscaling numbers, there can be challenges in achieving optimal transfer efficiency.

While Nvidia pushes the H100 to higher power consumption levels to extract greater performance, Google opts for a lower power, cost-effective design for TPUv5 and TPUv5e. This difference stems from Google's ability to pay lower margins for their chips, leading them to prioritize factors such as power consumption, networking cost, system cost, and deployment flexibility in their TCO calculations. In contrast, Nvidia's TCO equation is influenced by higher gross margins on hardware, causing a dominance of Capex over Opex costs. Additionally, Nvidia's architecture and SKU lineup enable them to pursue massive chips with higher parametric yields, while Google's lack of SKUing and reliance on smaller tensor units shapes their chip design strategy towards smaller, lower power chips.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/TPUv5e_The_New_Benchmark_in_Cost-Efficient_Inference_and_Training_for_200B_Parameter_Models.pdf"}

The restrictions are very strong and close most of the loopholes that were previously exploited. The restrictions removed the previous aggregate bidirectional transfer rate of 600 GB/s and aggregate TOPS x bit length of 4800 or more. This move aimed to prevent companies from releasing new chips with slightly lower aggregate bidirectional bandwidth while maintaining near identical performance in actual AI applications. As a result, chips such as Nvidia’s H800 and A800, Intel’s Gaudi 2 and 3, as well as AMD’s MI250X and MI300 are all blocked under the new restrictions. Furthermore, a new performance density threshold has been introduced, which is calculated as TPP divided by die area. This prevents shipments of chips with smaller die sizes that have less absolute compute power alone but are still dense and efficient from a computing standpoint.

With 46% of their revenue coming from China in the most recent quarter, due to a significant influx of rush orders before the long-rumored ban, only 5% to 7% of their total revenue in that quarter would have been blocked under the new rules. ASML confirmed that the rules essentially ban the TWINSCAN NXT:1980Di DUV lithography system from export to China, impacting “a handful of fabs” due to the “advanced” fabs loophole. Despite this, the majority of shipments into China are for the heavily subsidized mature nodes. Company executives emphasized that the vast majority of DUV system shipments were to support trailing edge and mature nodes, primarily driven by electric vehicle, communications, industrial IOT, and renewable energy end-use cases, as well as an overall strategy of reducing reliance on imported chips. They highlighted the highly sustainable demand from China due to the goal of achieving a level of self-sufficiency and explained that neither 2023 nor 2024 would see a peak in demand from China. Furthermore, the surge in deliveries to China in 2023 was attributed to ASML seizing the opportunity to fulfill orders for Chinese customers given the push back in demand from other customers, with the surge in demand again for use in trailing edge and mature processes rather than any concerted effort by China-based clients to beat future equipment bans.

By implementing the 4 tier InfiniBand network, the frontend network can solely focus on loading data and checkpointing, while the backend network can exclusively handle GPU to GPU communication. This segregation of tasks creates a more stable network pattern and improves overall performance. Additionally, the design of the alternative solution simplifies future upgrades by allowing easier scalability through the addition of fiber optics transceivers between switches in different buildings, as opposed to upgrading front-end network NIC in all chassis of the cluster individually.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/H100_Clusters_Power.pdf"}

The use of DAC cables results in less flapping and failures, which can be a major issue for high-speed interconnects using optics. Additionally, a Quantum-2 IB spine switch uses up to 1,500 watts when using multimode optical transceivers, compared to the 747 watts used when using DAC copper cables. Furthermore, initial cabling for a rail optimized design can be extremely time-consuming for data center technicians, as the ends of each link may be up to 50 meters away and not on the same rack. In comparison, a middle of rack design, where the leaf switch is in the same rack as the GPUs connecting to it, can be much more efficient.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/H100_Clusters_Power.pdf"}

With half-field stitching, the scanner steps over to a fresh area of the wafer and repeats the scan, resulting in stitching errors. Depth of focus and photoresist are challenges because increasing the NA of the scanner means that the depth of focus decreases, making it harder to focus, and the photoresist becomes more sensitive, making it more challenging to achieve the right contrast.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

This tradeoff requires chip designers to plan mask layouts and chip dimensions with both half-field and full-field imaging in mind, which can lead to high costs despite small die sizes if not optimized properly. Additionally, the use of high-NA scanners only on specific critical layers further complicates the design process, as cheaper tools with relaxed imaging capabilities will be used for other layers, introducing additional complexity to chip designs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

This results in a significant reduction in dose which allows the scanner to be used to its full potential, with throughput being limited by the speed of the wafer and mask stages rather than the dose. Additionally, despite requiring twice as many wafer passes through the scanner, the lithography costs are lower than a high-NA single exposure due to the strong throughput advantage of low-NA double patterning.  Furthermore, the cost advantage of low-NA double patterning increases as the CD shrinks, even between the 2 and  1.4nm nodes, and the faster stages developed for high-NA will be backported to future low-NA models, further improving their cost advantage over high-NA. It's important to consider the potential effects if source power cannot be increased up to 1kW, which could lead to a significant increase in lithography costs at future nodes. However, advancements in source power have been observed in each new EUV scanner model.  Overall, the advantage of low-NA double patterning lies in its ability to achieve lower dose requirements, maximize scanner potential, and ultimately lower lithography costs compared to high-NA single exposure techniques. These conclusions are supported by public materials from ASML.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

High-NA scanners were assumed to have a cost advantage over low-NA double patterning in 2020, but from 2021 onwards, the metric of choice changes from cost per wafer to process complexity. Chipmakers running 1000+ step wafer fabrication processes are used to complexity. They plan fabs and purchase equipment based on cost and projected yield, of which low-NA seems to perform better on. However, at the 1nm and 7A nodes, now in the 2030+ timeframe, the cost gap finally closes. Driving this is the paradigm change from geometry scaling to stacking \u2013 rather than shrinking features horizontally, chip performance power and area improvements are achieved by stacking features vertically. High-NA insertion is seen as the natural place for this change from 2d scaling to 3d scaling, and it changes the litho-intensity of advanced logic manufacturing heavily.

All-reduce between the many GPUs involved in pipeline parallelism is extremely costly, especially if the cluster is a bunch of smaller clusters with weaker networking between them. This means that the bubbles are extremely costly, and their training FLOPS for GPT-4 is ~ 2.15e25, taking around 90 to 100 days on ~25,000 A100s at about 32% to 36% MFU.

What are these tradeoffs?", "output": "The deployment of large language models for inference applications comes with tradeoffs such as higher utilization and increased latency. While many attribute memory capacity as a bottleneck for Large Language Model (LLM) inference, the need for multiple chips to accommodate large models is often overlooked. Despite the requirement of higher memory capacity for larger models, using more chips than necessary can help mitigate latency, increase throughput, and allow for larger batch sizes, resulting in higher utilization rates. These tradeoffs were demonstrated by Google in their PaLM inference paper, although it's important to note that this was specific to a dense model like PaLM and not a sparse model like GPT- 4. In scenarios where minimal latency is crucial, deploying more chips and strategically partitioning the model is essential. On the other hand, for applications prioritizing offline inference with no latency constraints, the focus shifts to maximizing per-chip throughput by increasing batch sizes. However, this introduces the challenge of networking time when using more chips and higher batch sizes. Additionally, memory requirements for the KV cache increase significantly with larger batch sizes and sequence lengths, impacting inference time. Notably, longer sequence lengths pose challenges related to memory bandwidth and capacity, resulting in constraints on batch sizes due to memory limitations.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

This is because with larger sequence lengths, the KV cache expands, increasing the need for individual memory reads as the KV cache cannot be shared between users. As a result, memory bandwidth becomes further bottlenecked, impacting throughput, latency, and utilization at higher batch sizes. In the case of GPT-4's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where each token generation forward pass can be routed to a different set of experts, having 16 experts with 2 routed per forward pass introduces complexities. For instance, with a batch size of 8, the parameter read for each expert could vary significantly, potentially leading to uneven distribution among experts in terms of batch sizes. This dynamic routing algorithm results in significant variation in token-to-token latency and expert batch sizes, posing challenges in optimizing inference performance. OpenAI opted for a smaller number of experts in GPT-4 to balance the trade-offs and avoid further exacerbating memory bandwidth bottlenecks during inference.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

While multiple Middle Eastern countries are investing heavily in enabling large-scale infrastructure for AI, some of the well-recognized AI firms in Europe, such as HuggingFace, Databricks (MosaicML), and Together, are also part of the GPU-poor group. These firms, despite having world-class researchers, are limited by working on systems with significantly fewer capabilities compared to their competitors like Nvidia, which offers multiple times as many GPUs in their DGX Cloud service and various in-house supercomputers. This gives Nvidia a significant advantage in terms of offering pretrained models, frameworks for data processing, vector databases, optimized inference engines, APIs, and personalized support to enterprises, thereby attracting more customers across different sectors like SaaS, insurance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and more. The significant partnerships and undisclosed collaborations of Nvidia further strengthen its position in the market, making it challenging for European AI firms to compete on the same level. The restriction on GPU resources due to limited funding means that companies like HuggingFace and Together will struggle to train advanced models that can cater to the high demands of enterprises, ultimately hindering their ability to capture a substantial market share.

Wafer-to-wafer (W2W) process involves bonding two fabricated wafers directly together, offering higher alignment accuracy, throughput, and bond yields. On the other hand, in Die-to-Wafer (D2W) process, individual dies are bonded to a wafer. Currently, the majority of hybrid bonding is done via W2W due to its relative ease and advantages. The higher bond yield in W2W is attributed to the separation of alignment and bonding steps. In W2W tools, a separate chamber performs the alignment before the wafers are moved into the bonding chamber, which is in a vacuum, for the actual bonding process. Additionally, W2W is a cleaner process with fewer steps, allowing for the cleaning of wafers before alignment and bonding, and reducing the potential for contamination. Furthermore, the die singulation, which can be a source of particle contamination, occurs only after the bond in the W2W process, contributing to its higher bond yield. Moreover, the longer alignment time for W2W, being a wafer-level process, does not significantly impact throughput as it would in a chip-level process. Lastly, the reduced movement in the chambers during W2W bonding results in fewer contaminants within the chamber itself, further enhancing the cleanliness of the process.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

This method is considered less mature compared to other bonding techniques. However, it is believed that going forward, direct D2W bonding will be used more due to its process simplification benefits. One advantage of collective D2W bonding is that cleaning can be performed, and then the chips can be directly sent into the alignment chamber to reduce contamination. Although D2W cluster tools are now being introduced to recreate this flow, reducing the benefits of the collective process, direct D2W bonding is still preferred for finer pad pitches as alignment becomes more challenging. Eliminating the W2W bonding step helps in reducing the risk of misalignment during the process. Despite the advantages, the challenges and costs associated with D2W hybrid bonding have limited its current applications. As of 2022, AMD was the first adopter of this technology, and they remain the only adopter in the industry.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

In a conventional flip chip package, the chip only requires interconnects on one side to receive power and communicate data with the package substrate. However, in a 3DIC design, where multiple die are stacked on top of each other, TSVs are essential to enable communication between the different layers of the chip. TSVs allow for interconnects on both sides of the chip, ensuring seamless communication between the package substrate, the die at the bottom, and the die on top. There are different variations of TSV fabrication, such as \"via-first,\" \"via-middle,\" and \"via-last,\" with the most common approach being the \"via-middle\" method that runs between the metal layers, through the transistor layers, and emerges on the backside of the chip. This intricate network of TSVs plays a crucial role in enabling the functionality of a 3DIC design.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

Together was the first to announce at $ 0.60 per million tokens with no input cost. This was followed by Perplexity at $ 0.14 input / $ 0.56 output, then Anyscale at $ 0.50 output, and finally Deepinfra at $ 0.27 output. However, the game changed when OpenRouter entered the scene offering token output for free. It's important to note that the presented tokens per second numbers by these companies are unachievable and come with stringent rate limits that hinder testing. Currently, all these inference offerings are operating at a loss. It's worth mentioning that the 2x H100 may not be the most cost-effective system for the Mixtral model; the 2x A100 80GB, with approximately 32% higher bandwidth per dollar, is a better option assuming a similar memory bandwidth utilization rate. Despite the lower FLOPS of the A100, it doesn't significantly impact inference performance. However, even with the collapsed pricing levels, there's practically no scenario where even 2xA100s can generate profits. Furthermore, the report will highlight the advantages brought by H200 and MI300X for inference tasks. The Mixtral model, being a mixture of experts model, behaves differently as batch size increases. At batch size 1, only a fraction of the parameters activate per forward pass, enhancing the model's capabilities with lower bandwidth and FLOPS per token. This scenario works best with batch size 1 and sufficient memory capacity to accommodate the model. With larger batch sizes, more model experts are activated, leading to the reading of all model parameters for each forward pass across all experts, while each decode token still passes through only two experts.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Inference_Race_To_The_Bottom.pdf"}

The first method involves placing dummy copper thermal vias, which act as \"heat pipes\" to conduct heat away from the hotspots. While this showed excellent thermal performance, the electrical performance was negatively affected due to the conductivity of copper.   A more promising approach was the use of thermally conductive layers between bonded wafers. By replacing the SiO2 bond with an inter-layer dielectric (ILD) with high thermal conductivity, thermal performance was improved without the adverse electrical effects. TSMC demonstrated the use of materials such as AlN and diamond, produced to a sub-micron thickness with high enough thermal conductivity to be viable.

As a result, DSA has been limited to niche applications, primarily in the production of image sensors by Sony. Additionally, the specificity of the pitch in DSA necessitates different formulations for each, posing a challenge for fabrication facilities.

Block copolymers, DSA, and specifically PS-b-PMMA are not new, but only EMD Electronics has publicly demonstrated the required level of process control and a plan for HVM. For equipment vendors, it is a similar story to Applied Material\u2019s Sculpta directional etch which has the potential to substantially reduce EUV layers reducing the need for multi-patterning. However, in the short term, both Sculpta and DSA are being marketed and implemented as \u201ccomplimentary\u201d to rather than \u201creplacing\u201d EUV. To be clear, when implemented, they do reduce spend that would go to lithography equipment. While DSA may reduce EUV multi-patterning, ASML still stands to benefit as it makes the economics of their ultra-expensive high-NA scanner much more palatable. TEL also has upside here as the DSA chemicals are spun-on and baked in the TEL track. Lam Research could also benefit because removing polar PMMA molecules requires dry etch, although TEL is trying to compete there too. Intel, while certainly the most public about its results, is not the only chipmaker working seriously on DSA. Specifically, TSMC sees the same need for EUV pattern rectification and is (quietly) performing development work on DSA as well for over a decade. As Intel embarks on 14A process development in earnest next year, we\u2019re looking forward to see if their bet pays off. They claim they will use DSA today, but they haven\u2019t even turned on their High NA EUV tool and began development and integration work. ASML Orders ASML had their earnings recently, and folks took it quite negatively with the stock being down over 7% after earnings were reported. The primary reason for this was that ASML has very little orders from their largest customers. TSMC and Samsung continue to be skittish on High NA EUV due to cost challenges.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Intel%E2%80%99s_14A_Magic_Bullet_Directed_Self-Assembly%20(DSA).pdf"}

Firstly, Amazon faces lower allocations of Nvidia GPUs, prompting them to lean towards alternative solutions. Additionally, Amazon has a strategy of subsidizing their own parts to stimulate the external ecosystem. This approach contrasts with Microsoft, whose AI accelerators are predominantly tailored for internal workloads due to their robust AI services and API business. Consequently, Microsoft prioritizes selecting the most cost-effective chip rather than subsidizing a product at a loss, a strategy adopted by Amazon. Despite Maia's superior performance, Amazon's strategic considerations drive them towards other options.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Microsoft_Infrastructure.pdf"}

If there is an overflow, the result exponent is increased by 1 and the mantissa is shifted downward. If the result is negative, it is converted back to an unsigned mantissa and the output sign is set to be negative. The mantissa is then normalized so that it has the leading 1 and the implicit leading 1 is removed.

The TPUv5 and TPUv5e are both designed with a focus on lower power consumption, memory bandwidth, and FLOPS compared to Nvidia\u2019s H 100. This deviation from peak performance in favor of reduced power consumption and cost-effectiveness is a deliberate choice made by Google, as they have the advantage of lower margins due to designing and acquiring their own chips. This leads to considerations of total cost of ownership (TCO) over a 4+ year period, where factors such as power consumption, networking cost, system cost, and deployment flexibility play significant roles. On the other hand, Nvidia's model is influenced by higher gross margins, shifting the TCO equation to be dominated by Capex with relatively smaller Opex costs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/TPUv5e_The_New_Benchmark_in_Cost-Efficient_Inference_and_Training_for_200B_Parameter_Models.pdf"}

While Nvidia pushes the H100 to higher power consumption levels to extract greater performance, Google opts for a lower power, cost-effective design for TPUv5 and TPUv5e. This difference stems from Google's ability to pay lower margins for their chips, leading them to prioritize factors such as power consumption, networking cost, system cost, and deployment flexibility in their TCO calculations. In contrast, Nvidia's TCO equation is influenced by higher gross margins on hardware, causing a dominance of Capex over Opex costs. Additionally, Nvidia's architecture and SKU lineup enable them to pursue massive chips with higher parametric yields, while Google's lack of SKUing and reliance on smaller tensor units shapes their chip design strategy towards smaller, lower power chips.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/TPUv5e_The_New_Benchmark_in_Cost-Efficient_Inference_and_Training_for_200B_Parameter_Models.pdf"}

With 46% of their revenue coming from China in the most recent quarter, due to a significant influx of rush orders before the long-rumored ban, only 5% to 7% of their total revenue in that quarter would have been blocked under the new rules.

Company executives emphasized that the vast majority of DUV system shipments were to support trailing edge and mature nodes, primarily driven by electric vehicle, communications, industrial IOT, and renewable energy end-use cases, as well as an overall strategy of reducing reliance on imported chips. They highlighted the highly sustainable demand from China due to the goal of achieving a level of self-sufficiency and explained that neither 2023 nor 2024 would see a peak in demand from China.

The use of DAC cables results in less flapping and failures, which can be a major issue for high-speed interconnects using optics. Additionally, a Quantum-2 IB spine switch uses up to 1,500 watts when using multimode optical transceivers, compared to the 747 watts used when using DAC copper cables. Furthermore, initial cabling for a rail optimized design can be extremely time-consuming for data center technicians, as the ends of each link may be up to 50 meters away and not on the same rack.

However, datacenters generally have constant power usage 24x7, while solar power does not generate constant power throughout the day. Therefore, it is challenging to rely solely on solar power to meet the energy needs of datacenters. Additionally, space constraints and development planning make it difficult to build renewable plants on-site to directly power datacenters. Wind and hydro power can be alternative options, but again, they also have limitations in providing constant power. To address this issue, companies often procure renewable energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), where the renewable energy project sells its power into the grid, and the datacenter purchases its needs from the grid. This allows companies to support renewable energy but does not guarantee that the datacenter is solely using renewable energy. Consequently, datacenters still rely on a mix of other fuels such as coal and natural gas, resulting in carbon emissions. Even if datacenters contribute renewable energy to the grid, they still increase the need for fossil fuel power generation during low renewable energy generation periods. This conundrum acknowledges the challenge of achieving 100% renewable energy consumption for datacenters. However, companies like Microsoft have committed to a long-term vision of sourcing 100% of their electricity consumption from zero-carbon sources.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/AI_Datacenter_Energy_Dilemma.pdf"}

Half-field stitching is a challenge because lithography scanners expose wafers through an exposure slit and move the wafer under the slit to expose a pattern from the photomask onto the wafer. With half-field stitching, the scanner steps over to a fresh area of the wafer and repeats the scan, resulting in stitching errors. Depth of focus and photoresist are challenges because increasing the NA of the scanner means that the depth of focus decreases, making it harder to focus, and the photoresist becomes more sensitive, making it more challenging to achieve the right contrast.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

With the exposure field size for high-NA scanners being only half that of low-NA EUV and traditional DUV tools, the necessity of mixing half- and full-field exposures on the same wafer becomes an issue. This tradeoff requires chip designers to plan mask layouts and chip dimensions with both half-field and full-field imaging in mind, which can lead to high costs despite small die sizes if not optimized properly. Additionally, the use of high-NA scanners only on specific critical layers further complicates the design process, as cheaper tools with relaxed imaging capabilities will be used for other layers, introducing additional complexity to chip designs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

High-NA scanners were assumed to have a cost advantage over low-NA double patterning in 2020, but from 2021 onwards, the metric of choice changes from cost per wafer to process complexity. Chipmakers running 1000+ step wafer fabrication processes are used to complexity. They plan fabs and purchase equipment based on cost and projected yield, of which low-NA seems to perform better on. However, at the 1nm and 7A nodes, now in the 2030+ timeframe, the cost gap finally closes. Driving this is the paradigm change from geometry scaling to stacking \u2013 rather than shrinking features horizontally, chip performance power and area improvements are achieved by stacking features vertically. High-NA insertion is seen as the natural place for this change from 2d scaling to 3d scaling, and it changes the litho-intensity of advanced logic manufacturing heavily. Therefore, chipmakers have purchased at least 10 orders for high-NA systems for their future production needs.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

As far as overlay challenges, it appears that low-NA EUV will still have better fidelity even with LELE schemes, let alone self-aligned schemes. Our analysis shows high-NA reaches cost parity & use in high-volume wafer manufacturing at the 1nm node, in 2030 or  31. This is 1 or 2 nodes and as many as 5 years later than publicly forecast by ASML.

Chiplets similar to this are pervasive in modern multi-chip module designs, such as AMD\u2019s MI 300. In a case like this where the die dimensions are non-optimal, the lithography costs of combining half- and full-field exposures are higher than using only full-field. One option is to layout as many die as possible on the full field mask, here more than 90% of the mask is utilized. The corresponding high-NA, half field mask unfortunately has poor utilization and requires the scanner to image 3 high-NA fields for every full field exposure. Imaging a higher number of fields (the nominal case is 2 half-fields to match a single full field) means more time wasted stepping between them.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/ASML_Dilemma_High.pdf"}

One significant challenge is the increased generation of particles from the high number of mask swaps. The mechanical process of unloading one mask and clamping another during mask swaps runs the risk of generating particles. Even a single foreign particle on the mask can substantially impact yield as it affects the image printed on every die imaged. Moreover, in legacy processes, masks are typically swapped much less often, with each lot of 25 wafers or even less frequently, thus highlighting the potential for increased particle generation with field stitching. Furthermore, accurate placement of metrology targets in the active area of the chip is essential to assist with field stitching, requiring high precision in aligning the 2 fields to create functional features that cross between them.

Furthermore, the Armv9 instruction set and A510 cores utilized by Arm are from their Cambridge headquarters. The A510 cores are specifically designed at Arm's Sophia France R&D center and Cambridge. The chip showcases remarkable technical capabilities, demonstrating performance and power efficiency comparable to Qualcomm chips that are one to two years old, such as the S888 and S8G1 models. Particularly, the RF aspect of the chip stands out, featuring an integrated modem that rivals Qualcomm's latest offerings. This level of technological prowess is not unexpected considering Huawei's previous lead over Qualcomm before facing restrictions from using TSMC. Notably, the RF Front End chips are domestically produced, challenging the perception that such capabilities were lacking in China. Surprisingly, direct comparisons between Arm's A510 for Huawei's Kirin 9000S, built on SMIC's N+2 (7nm) process, and the 2022 Qualcomm S8G1, built on Samsung's 4LPX process, revealed that the performance and power efficiency of the Arm A510 cores are comparable despite the process technology gap. This indicates that SMIC N+2 is more advanced than commonly recognized in the West. One contributing factor to the comparable performance of these chips is Samsung's low yield and SMIC's high yield. In essence, the Kirin 9000S chip is a more sophisticated design than many in the Western market may realize.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/China_AI_Semiconductors_Rise_US_Sanctions_Have_Failed.pdf"}

Companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, KLA, and others are selling a wide range of tools to China, including deposition, etch, metrology, cleaning, and other equipment that can be used for nodes as advanced as 7nm and 5nm, but are being claimed for 28nm use by entities like SMIC. This is a major concern because it allows China to advance its semiconductor production capabilities using tools meant for less advanced nodes. The failure of end use checks means that these tools are being diverted to more advanced nodes than intended, potentially with the knowledge of some individuals within these equipment companies who may be turning a blind eye to the misuse. The export controls in place are not being effectively enforced, leading to the continuation of this problematic status quo. For example, in the case of lithography equipment, though there are some restrictions on specific DUV tools, these restrictions are insufficient to prevent China from ramping up 7nm production.

The reality is that even 8xH100 servers struggle to serve a 1 trillion parameter dense model at  33.33 tokens per second, with low FLOPS utilization rates resulting in high inference costs. The inference constraint for an 8-way tensor parallel H100 system hovers around ~300 billion feed-forward parameters. However, OpenAI has managed to achieve human reading speed with A100s, using a model larger than 1 trillion parameters by employing sparsity, where not every parameter is utilized, enabling them to offer their services at a low price.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPU_Cloud_Economics_Explained.pdf"}

This is because with larger sequence lengths, the KV cache expands, increasing the need for individual memory reads as the KV cache cannot be shared between users. As a result, memory bandwidth becomes further bottlenecked, impacting throughput, latency, and utilization at higher batch sizes. In the case of GPT-4's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where each token generation forward pass can be routed to a different set of experts, having 16 experts with 2 routed per forward pass introduces complexities. For instance, with a batch size of 8, the parameter read for each expert could vary significantly, potentially leading to uneven distribution among experts in terms of batch sizes. This dynamic routing algorithm results in significant variation in token-to-token latency and expert batch sizes, posing challenges in optimizing inference performance.

In contrast, scaling a 3D torus network may involve reconfiguring the entire topology, which can be complex and time-consuming. Moreover, the Clos networks offer more paths between any two nodes, allowing for better load balancing and redundancy. While 3D torus networks also provide multiple paths, the number of alternative paths in Clos networks can be higher, depending on the network's configuration. However, it's important to note that Google\u2019s OCS mitigates many of these issues, enabling simple scaling between multiple slices and multiple pods, and routing to be reconfigured on the fly.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Google_AI_Infrastructure_Supremacy.pdf"}

Wafer-to-wafer (W2W) process involves bonding two fabricated wafers directly together, offering higher alignment accuracy, throughput, and bond yields. On the other hand, in Die-to-Wafer (D2W) process, individual dies are bonded to a wafer. Currently, the majority of hybrid bonding is done via W2W due to its relative ease and advantages. The higher bond yield in W2W is attributed to the separation of alignment and bonding steps. In W2W tools, a separate chamber performs the alignment before the wafers are moved into the bonding chamber, which is in a vacuum, for the actual bonding process. Additionally, W2W is a cleaner process with fewer steps, allowing for the cleaning of wafers before alignment and bonding, and reducing the potential for contamination. Furthermore, the die singulation, which can be a source of particle contamination, occurs only after the bond in the W2W process, contributing to its higher bond yield. Moreover, the longer alignment time for W2W, being a wafer-level process, does not significantly impact throughput as it would in a chip-level process. Lastly, the reduced movement in the chambers during W2W bonding results in fewer contaminants within the chamber itself, further enhancing the cleanliness of the process.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Hybrid_Bonding_Process_Flow.pdf"}

It can deal with worse yields but still have a commercially viable product. To get around limitations we need to go to D2W. D2W bonding is much more challenging. After a wafer sort is performed, KGD are singulated from the top wafer, and attached individually onto the base wafer via a pick and place tool.

This method is considered less mature compared to other bonding techniques. However, it is believed that going forward, direct D2W bonding will be used more due to its process simplification benefits. One advantage of collective D2W bonding is that cleaning can be performed, and then the chips can be directly sent into the alignment chamber to reduce contamination. Although D2W cluster tools are now being introduced to recreate this flow, reducing the benefits of the collective process, direct D2W bonding is still preferred for finer pad pitches as alignment becomes more challenging. Eliminating the W2W bonding step helps in reducing the risk of misalignment during the process. Despite the advantages, the challenges and costs associated with D2W hybrid bonding have limited its current applications.

However, limitations arose as one of the wafers needed to be transparent to infrared, which doesn't suit CMOS wafers due to the inability of IR to see through the metal layers. Notably, EVG, a dominant force in W2W bonding, has developed their patented SmartView alignment technology. Following the alignment step, the bonding step occurs to yield a higher W2W bond, forming the initial dielectric-dielectric bond, which is a weak van der Waals bond.

However, the game changed when OpenRouter entered the scene offering token output for free. It's important to note that the presented tokens per second numbers by these companies are unachievable and come with stringent rate limits that hinder testing. Currently, all these inference offerings are operating at a loss. It's worth mentioning that the 2x H100 may not be the most cost-effective system for the Mixtral model; the 2x A100 80GB, with approximately 32% higher bandwidth per dollar, is a better option assuming a similar memory bandwidth utilization rate. Despite the lower FLOPS of the A100, it doesn't significantly impact inference performance. However, even with the collapsed pricing levels, there's practically no scenario where even 2xA100s can generate profits. Furthermore, the report will highlight the advantages brought by H200 and MI300X for inference tasks. The Mixtral model, being a mixture of experts model, behaves differently as batch size increases.

First, the difference in exponents is taken. Then, the mantissa2 is shifted downward by (exp1 - exp2) to align with mantissa 1. After adding in an implicit leading 1 to each mantissa, the mantissas are added together to form the output mantissa. If there is an overflow, the result exponent is increased by 1 and the mantissa is shifted downward. If the result is negative, it is converted back to an unsigned mantissa and the output sign is set to be negative. The mantissa is then normalized so that it has the leading 1 and the implicit leading 1 is removed.

This alignment ensures that the data can be transferred effectively without loss or truncation. However, when DRAM transfers occur in increments of 16 or 32 but require a block transfer of 32 or 64 microscaling numbers, there can be challenges in achieving optimal transfer efficiency.

While Nvidia pushes the H100 to higher power consumption levels to extract greater performance, Google opts for a lower power, cost-effective design for TPUv5 and TPUv5e. This difference stems from Google's ability to pay lower margins for their chips, leading them to prioritize factors such as power consumption, networking cost, system cost, and deployment flexibility in their TCO calculations. In contrast, Nvidia's TCO equation is influenced by higher gross margins on hardware, causing a dominance of Capex over Opex costs. Additionally, Nvidia's architecture and SKU lineup enable them to pursue massive chips with higher parametric yields, while Google's lack of SKUing and reliance on smaller tensor units shapes their chip design strategy towards smaller, lower power chips.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/TPUv5e_The_New_Benchmark_in_Cost-Efficient_Inference_and_Training_for_200B_Parameter_Models.pdf"}

With 46% of their revenue coming from China in the most recent quarter, due to a significant influx of rush orders before the long-rumored ban, only 5% to 7% of their total revenue in that quarter would have been blocked under the new rules. ASML confirmed that the rules essentially ban the TWINSCAN NXT:1980Di DUV lithography system from export to China, impacting \u201ca handful of fabs\u201d due to the \u201cadvanced\u201d fabs loophole. Despite this, the majority of shipments into China are for the heavily subsidized mature nodes. Company executives emphasized that the vast majority of DUV system shipments were to support trailing edge and mature nodes, primarily driven by electric vehicle, communications, industrial IOT, and renewable energy end-use cases, as well as an overall strategy of reducing reliance on imported chips. They highlighted the highly sustainable demand from China due to the goal of achieving a level of self-sufficiency and explained that neither 2023 nor 2024 would see a peak in demand from China. Furthermore, the surge in deliveries to China in 2023 was attributed to ASML seizing the opportunity to fulfill orders for Chinese customers given the push back in demand from other customers, with the surge in demand again for use in trailing edge and mature processes rather than any concerted effort by China-based clients to beat future equipment bans. Lam Research, the largest etch company, also experienced a similar story, with their revenue soaring 102% quarter on quarter from China to $1,671M, primarily off the backs of rush orders before any potential bans.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/Wafer_Wars_Deciphering_Latest_Restrictions_On_AI_And_Semiconductor_Manufacturing.pdf"}

While there are 1,000 times more high-quality text tokens available, sourcing them is not as simple as conducting a web scrape. Additionally, sourcing audio and visual tokens is even more complicated than sourcing text tokens. OpenAI mentions that there are millions of rows of instruction fine-tuning data from sources like ScaleAI and internal data, but there is limited information available on their RLHF data. During the pre-training phase of GPT-4, an 8k context length (seqlen) was used, and the 32k seqlen version of GPT-4 is based on fine-tuning the 8k model. The batch size used during training was gradually increased over several days on the cluster, eventually reaching a batch size of 60 million. However, this translates to a batch size of  7.5 million tokens per expert because not every expert sees all tokens. OpenAI employed parallelism strategies to optimize training efficiency. They used 8-way tensor parallelism, as it is the limit for NVLink, and also implemented 15-way pipeline parallelism. Although using many pipelines can pose challenges in terms of data communication versus compute time, it can be beneficial if memory capacity is a limiting factor. Each GPU required approximately 30GB just for the parameters at FP16 when utilizing pipeline + tensor parallelism, and this is likely due to the use of 40GB A100 GPUs. OpenAI may have utilized ZeRo Stage 1 and potentially employed block-level FSDP or hybrid shared data parallelism, rather than full model FSDP, to mitigate higher communication overhead.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPT-4_Architecture_Infrastructure.pdf"}

It is likely that they simply ate the cost. The bubbles caused by the low bandwidth connections are extremely costly, and all-reduce between that many GPUs is also extremely costly. This is especially true if, as suspected, the cluster is really a bunch of smaller clusters with much weaker networking between them. It is estimated that if the cost in the cloud was about $1 per A100 hour, the training costs for GPT-4 would be about $63 million. This ignores all the experimentation, failed training runs, and other costs such as data gathering, RLHF, staff, etc.  This passage discusses the trend of large language models (LLMs) and the challenges involved in training and deploying them.   Key points include:  * Increasing compute resources are enabling more firms to train large models comparable to GPT- 4. * Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a technique used to reduce the number of parameters during inference while maintaining a large model size for training. * MoE has tradeoffs, as not all parts of the model are always used, leading to inefficiencies in inference. * OpenAI's choice of 16 experts in GPT-4 might be due to the difficulty of generalizing models with a larger number of experts.   The passage also touches on the importance of high-quality training data, which is scarce and expensive to acquire.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPT-4_Architecture_Infrastructure.pdf"}

The first tradeoff is latency, where the model must respond in reasonable latency to avoid making users wait many seconds for their output in applications like chat. Prefill (input tokens) and decode (output tokens) take varying amounts of time to process. The second tradeoff is throughput, where the model must output a certain number of tokens per second to ensure efficiency. Finally, there are tradeoffs related to the resources used, such as the number of experts in the training run, which can impact convergence and inference infrastructure.  This is a good explanation of the challenges of LLM inference, particularly around balancing memory bandwidth and compute.   You've accurately highlighted the issue of  imbalanced ratios in chips like the H100 when dealing with single-user requests (batch size 1). Reading in all those parameters for each token becomes the bottleneck, overshadowing compute time.  Grouping multiple user requests together (increasing batch size) is a key solution to this problem.  By amortizing the parameter read cost across more users, the memory bandwidth utilization improves significantly, bringing the compute and memory aspects into a more balanced relationship.   The examples of batch sizes 256 and 512 illustrate this point well, showing how the FLOPs per byte of memory read increase, aligning better with the H100's capabilities.       It seems you're discussing the tradeoffs involved in deploying large language models (LLMs) at scale. You've touched on several key factors:  * **Latency vs. Throughput:** Using more chips can reduce latency, but it increases communication overhead. * **Batch Size:** Larger batch sizes improve throughput and utilization, but can exacerbate memory limitations. * **Memory Capacity:**  LLMs require significant memory, and the need for KV cache for attention mechanisms further increases this demand. * **Sequence Length:** Longer sequences place a heavy burden on memory bandwidth and capacity.  The optimal configuration depends heavily on the specific application requirements. Real-time applications prioritize low latency, while offline tasks may focus on maximizing throughput and cost efficiency.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPT-4_Architecture_Infrastructure.pdf"}

This customized version with the Ariel board is anticipated to be predominantly utilized by Meta. Meta, owing to the demands of their recommendation system training and inferencing workloads, necessitates a higher CPU core and memory per GPU ratio to accommodate extensive embedding tables storage and conduct pre/post-processing on the CPUs. In the Ariel variant, the Bianca board is replaced by an Ariel board that hosts 1 Grace CPU and 1 Blackwell GPU. This change results in a higher cost for the NVL36x2 compared to other models. Moreover, each NVSwitch tray in the NVL36x2 is equipped with 18  1.6T twin-port OSFP cages that horizontally connect to a pair NVL36 rack.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

The NVL36x2 is specifically designed to handle GenAI tasks efficiently. In contrast, the Ariel version with its overprovisioned CPUs may not be as cost-effective from a total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective due to the elevated capital cost and power consumption associated with it. While the Ariel version can technically support GenAI workloads, the NVL36x2 stands out as the more advantageous choice for such tasks in terms of performance and cost efficiency.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

This configuration will employ 288 L1 NVSwitch5 ASICs located in the compute racks such as NVL36x 2. Additionally, 144 L2 NVSwitch ASICs will be positioned on dedicated NV Switch trays. The GPUs will be connected to the L1 NVSwitch using the same copper backplane due to the short distance. However, optical connections become necessary between the L1 NVSwitch and the L2 NVSwitch due to the greater distance. Moreover, the L2 NVSwitches will utilize Flyover cables to reach the OSFP cages on the front of the chassis. The additional Bill of Materials (BOM) cost for NVL576 is exceedingly high, exceeding $ 5.6 million, translating to around  9.7k per GPU. To maintain a 75% gross margin, customers would potentially need to shell out an extra  38.8k per GPU for the NVL576 copper and optical connections. Despite the option for Nvidia to reduce margins, even offering 0% for the scale out NVLink solution, it remains unfeasible due to the exorbitant costs associated with optics. This situational similarity led to the non-release of the DGX H100 NVL 256. Optics prove to be prohibitively expensive for the accelerator interconnect as high bandwidth is a critical requirement.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

Please provide me with the text you would like me to analyze.     This text describes the liquid cooling system of a computing system, likely a data center server.   It explains how the heat from components like GPUs and CPUs is transferred to a coolant, which is then circulated through a loop and cooled by a radiator or a heat exchanger.   The text also highlights that while the Bianca board is primarily liquid cooled, the front portion of the tray containing other components is air-cooled.    Finally, it mentions different liquid cooling form factors:  * L2A (liquid to air) * L2L (liquid to liquid) *  and a third form factor which is not listed.         This passage describes the details of two Data Center (DC) form factors, L2A and L2L, used in the deployment of Nvidia's GB200 platform.   Here are some key takeaways:  * **Cooling Technologies:**  Nvidia currently supports air cooling and Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) for GB200 deployments. Immersion cooling, while existing, is not yet mature enough for widespread adoption and lacks serviceability.   * **L2A and L2L Form Factors:** Both L2A and L2L utilize cold plates, CDMs, and QDs for cooling within the IT rack. The key difference lies in the heat rejection method:     * **L2A** (Rear Door Heat Exchanger or RDHx) uses air as the medium to reject heat from the Technology Cooling System (TCS) to the Cooling Rack/In-Rack CDU.     * **L2L** utilizes facility water as the medium to reject heat from the TCS to the Cooling Rack/In-Rack CDU.    Let me know if you have any other questions about this passage.   This text describes two different liquid cooling solutions for data centers: RDHx and Sidecar.   RDHx is a solution where the radiator, fans, and pump units are all located on the back of the IT rack.  Sidecar, on the other hand, uses a separate cooling rack for these components, allowing for more radiator space and thus higher cooling capacity.  The text also clarifies that some RDHx solutions are actually air-to-liquid (A2L) and not true liquid cooling as previously believed.    The cooling capacity of RDHx is limited to around 30kW-40kW, making it insufficient for larger server racks. Sidecar solutions, with capacities ranging from 70kW to 140kW, are better suited for handling the higher TDP of modern server racks like the NVL36 and NVL 72.      This text describes two different data center cooling solutions: L2A and L2L.   L2A uses air cooling, where the heat generated by the servers is dissipated into the data center air and removed by traditional air conditioners (CRAC/CRAH).  L2L uses liquid cooling, where a coolant circulates through the servers and then exchanges heat with a facility water system.

In addition to the power consumption savings, the total usage effectiveness (TUE) also sees a significant improvement, decreasing by more than 15%. For example, while the TUE for air cooling typically hovers around  1.4 for hyperscalers (approximately  1.55 for neoclouds), the TUE drops to  1.15 for Liquid-to-Liquid (L2L) cooling systems. This is achieved by requiring fewer fans compared to air cooling systems and ensuring uninterrupted airflow into the data center, contributing to the enhanced energy efficiency of liquid cooling solutions.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

However, the deployment of L2L systems currently faces two significant delaying factors and bottlenecks. Firstly, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) prioritize the speed of deployment over the energy efficiency gains provided by L2L cooling solutions. Secondly, securing permits for sourcing water for the facility water system, despite the completion of site installation of piping to support L2L, poses a challenge. Consequently, to ensure rapid deployment of GB200 systems, hyperscalers are adopting L2A as a short-term contingency solution. It is anticipated that the majority of GB200 volume will be in L2A form before the third quarter of  2025.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

Ultimately, the decision on suppliers is made by end customers or OEMs based on their procurement strategies. For example, Tier-1 CSPs aim to procure from 1 or 2 suppliers for each liquid cooling component. At COMPUTEX 2024, over 80 liquid cooling suppliers showcased their liquid cooling solutions as well as production capacity. 5 of us from SemiAnalysis were there and had conversations with every firm. With some simple math on capacity number, this raised an oversupply concerns before the party even got going. From our supply chain checks, many suppliers claim they have capacity, but very few have been listed on the reference vendor list let alone winning any significant orders. On top of this, quality and track record of the supplier is considered the most important determinant in the procurement decision chain.

As end customers value quality and wish to avoid system failure over prices for components which are an insignificant percentage of GB200 BOM. We believe there will be less competition and pricing pressure on these components. In other words, there are very little incentives for end customers to replace incumbent suppliers at the risk of leakage.  This is a detailed description of the supplier landscape and component considerations for a high-powered data center infrastructure, likely related to a specific product or platform like the GB 200.   Here's a breakdown of the key points:  * **Cold Plate & QD Suppliers:** The market resembles that of 3DVC, but with additional players like AVC, Cooler Masters, Delta, and Auras. QD suppliers are predominantly US/European with CPC, Parker Hannifin, Danfoss, and Staubli being key vendors. CPC's clean room factory highlights the specialized manufacturing needs of QDs. * **Supply Constraints:** There's a current shortage of QDs, potentially hindering GB200 shipments.  * **CDM & CDU Competition:**  CDM (likely a component related to liquid cooling distribution) and CDU (Cooling Distribution Unit) are expected to be more competitive due to lower barriers to entry in manufacturing. * **CDM Manufacturing:**  While soldering QDs onto manifolds for CDM is not technically complex, proper execution is crucial to prevent leaks. * **CDU Market Dynamics:** While individual components of CDUs (BPHE, RPU, etc.) are not difficult to manufacture, the market will likely favor established suppliers offering complete system integration, telemetry/monitoring, and robust servicing/maintenance capabilities. * **Power Delivery Network Evolution:**  With increasing TDP (Thermal Design Power) per rack from H100 4-node configurations to GB200 NVL72 racks, the power delivery network is shifting from node-level PSUs to centralized rack-level PSUs. This change reflects the higher power demands of modern data centers.   This information suggests a focus on liquid cooling solutions and advancements in power distribution for high-performance computing systems.   This text describes the power architecture of a data center called GB 200.   It details the following:  * **Power Efficiency:** GB200 is designed for greater power efficiency compared to conventional designs. This is achieved through centralized power supply units (PSUs), a shift from 12VDC to 48VDC architecture, and reduced oversizing and redundancy in the PSU design. * **Power Shelf Configuration:** GB200 racks have power shelves at the top and bottom, each housing six  5.5kW PSUs, resulting in a total of 33kW per power shelf. These shelves accept 346-480V AC and output 48/50V DC. * **Power Distribution:** Power from the shelves flows through busbars at the rear of the rack to the server trays.  A power distribution board (PDB) steps down the 48V DC to 12V and distributes it to the components within the tray, including the Bianca board and fans.  * **Component Powering:** The Bianca board receives 12V power from the PDB, while the fans are powered through the Bianca board using 8-pin Molex connectors. * **Supply Chain:**  The text mentions the supply chain for PDBs and voltage regulators (VRMs) on the Bianca board, highlighting the diversity of suppliers, with some companies like Alpha Omega having a share in the PDB market. The VRM market appears to be more concentrated with major players like Monolithic Power Systems, Renesas, and Infineon. * **BMC:** The text briefly describes the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), a specialized processor used for remote monitoring and management of the host systems.

It is used in servers and some datacenter equipment, such as NIC, power supplier, and DPU. Servers usually have an average of one to two BMCs per general server, but for AI servers, the BMC content per server varies based on form factors and SKUs. In the GB200 NVL72 reference design with two Bluefield-3, there are 87 BMCs, including several BMCs for different components such as compute tray, HMC, DC-SCM, and Bluefield-3 DPU. Among major buyers, some prefer custom NICs instead of Bluefield-3 for HGX and NVL72/NVL36, while Oracle uses Bluefield-3, but only one for its NVL36*2 system.

SK Hynix has presented extensively on HBM packaging, including in-depth details about their MR-MUF technology. MR-MUF, which stands for Mass Reflow – Molded Underfill, is a higher throughput method compared to TC-NCF, as it utilizes a batch solder reflow process instead of individual bonding for each layer.    MR-MUF employs an epoxy molding compound with higher thermal conductivity than the non-conductive film used in TC-NCF, leading to lower junction temperatures, particularly beneficial for power-intensive chips like GPUs.    Hynix highlighted the challenges associated with MR-MUF, emphasizing their unique solutions.  These solutions involve co-engineered materials, offering them exclusivity in addressing warpage control, a significant issue with high free-standing stacks of thin dies.  Their approach involves a pre-stressed film deposited on the wafer backside, effectively mitigating warpage and ensuring proper junction formation.       This text discusses various advancements in the semiconductor industry, focusing on high bandwidth memory (HBM) technologies and packaging techniques.   Some key points raised include:  * **Challenges in HBM Underfill:**  The text highlights the difficulty of filling the gaps between dies in HBM packages with underfill material, particularly due to the increased density of bumps and narrower gaps. Hynix has been working on optimizing mold tools and dispense patterns to minimize voids in the underfill, which are detrimental to structural support.  * **HBM4 Roadmap and Packaging:**  The discussion turns to SK Hynix's roadmap for HBM4, which will feature a 2048-bit bus width, leading to larger package sizes.  The choice between MR-MUF and hybrid bonding as the packaging technology for HBM4 is still undecided, posing a challenge to BESI's narrative.  * **Hybrid Bonding Advantages:** Hybrid bonding (HB) is presented as a promising technology for HBM due to its bump-less nature, eliminating the die gap and providing more space for additional dies. Additionally, HB offers advantages in form factor and heat dissipation.  * **Relaxed I/O Density:** The text notes that HBM does not require the same high I/O density as logic devices, allowing for a relaxed pad pitch and easier alignment.

As end customers value quality and wish to avoid system failure over prices for components which are an insignificant percentage of GB200 BOM. We believe there will be less competition and pricing pressure on these components. In other words, there are very little incentives for end customers to replace incumbent suppliers at the risk of leakage.  This is a detailed description of the supplier landscape and component considerations for a high-powered data center infrastructure, likely related to a specific product or platform like the GB 200.   Here's a breakdown of the key points:  * **Cold Plate & QD Suppliers:** The market resembles that of 3DVC, but with additional players like AVC, Cooler Masters, Delta, and Auras. QD suppliers are predominantly US/European with CPC, Parker Hannifin, Danfoss, and Staubli being key vendors. CPC's clean room factory highlights the specialized manufacturing needs of QDs. * **Supply Constraints:** There's a current shortage of QDs, potentially hindering GB200 shipments.  * **CDM & CDU Competition:**  CDM (likely a component related to liquid cooling distribution) and CDU (Cooling Distribution Unit) are expected to be more competitive due to lower barriers to entry in manufacturing. * **CDM Manufacturing:**  While soldering QDs onto manifolds for CDM is not technically complex, proper execution is crucial to prevent leaks. * **CDU Market Dynamics:** While individual components of CDUs (BPHE, RPU, etc.) are not difficult to manufacture, the market will likely favor established suppliers offering complete system integration, telemetry/monitoring, and robust servicing/maintenance capabilities. * **Power Delivery Network Evolution:**  With increasing TDP (Thermal Design Power) per rack from H100 4-node configurations to GB200 NVL72 racks, the power delivery network is shifting from node-level PSUs to centralized rack-level PSUs. This change reflects the higher power demands of modern data centers.   This information suggests a focus on liquid cooling solutions and advancements in power distribution for high-performance computing systems.   This text describes the power architecture of a data center called GB 200.   It details the following:  * **Power Efficiency:** GB200 is designed for greater power efficiency compared to conventional designs. This is achieved through centralized power supply units (PSUs), a shift from 12VDC to 48VDC architecture, and reduced oversizing and redundancy in the PSU design. * **Power Shelf Configuration:** GB200 racks have power shelves at the top and bottom, each housing six  5.5kW PSUs, resulting in a total of 33kW per power shelf. These shelves accept 346-480V AC and output 48/50V DC. * **Power Distribution:** Power from the shelves flows through busbars at the rear of the rack to the server trays.  A power distribution board (PDB) steps down the 48V DC to 12V and distributes it to the components within the tray, including the Bianca board and fans.  * **Component Powering:** The Bianca board receives 12V power from the PDB, while the fans are powered through the Bianca board using 8-pin Molex connectors. * **Supply Chain:**  The text mentions the supply chain for PDBs and voltage regulators (VRMs) on the Bianca board, highlighting the diversity of suppliers, with some companies like Alpha Omega having a share in the PDB market. The VRM market appears to be more concentrated with major players like Monolithic Power Systems, Renesas, and Infineon. * **BMC:** The text briefly describes the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), a specialized processor used for remote monitoring and management of the host systems.

While there are 1,000 times more high-quality text tokens available, sourcing them is not as simple as conducting a web scrape. Additionally, sourcing audio and visual tokens is even more complicated than sourcing text tokens. OpenAI mentions that there are millions of rows of instruction fine-tuning data from sources like ScaleAI and internal data, but there is limited information available on their RLHF data. During the pre-training phase of GPT-4, an 8k context length (seqlen) was used, and the 32k seqlen version of GPT-4 is based on fine-tuning the 8k model. The batch size used during training was gradually increased over several days on the cluster, eventually reaching a batch size of 60 million. However, this translates to a batch size of  7.5 million tokens per expert because not every expert sees all tokens. OpenAI employed parallelism strategies to optimize training efficiency. They used 8-way tensor parallelism, as it is the limit for NVLink, and also implemented 15-way pipeline parallelism. Although using many pipelines can pose challenges in terms of data communication versus compute time, it can be beneficial if memory capacity is a limiting factor. Each GPU required approximately 30GB just for the parameters at FP16 when utilizing pipeline + tensor parallelism, and this is likely due to the use of 40GB A100 GPUs.

The first tradeoff is latency, where the model must respond in reasonable latency to avoid making users wait many seconds for their output in applications like chat. Prefill (input tokens) and decode (output tokens) take varying amounts of time to process. The second tradeoff is throughput, where the model must output a certain number of tokens per second to ensure efficiency. Finally, there are tradeoffs related to the resources used, such as the number of experts in the training run, which can impact convergence and inference infrastructure.  This is a good explanation of the challenges of LLM inference, particularly around balancing memory bandwidth and compute.   You've accurately highlighted the issue of  imbalanced ratios in chips like the H100 when dealing with single-user requests (batch size 1). Reading in all those parameters for each token becomes the bottleneck, overshadowing compute time.  Grouping multiple user requests together (increasing batch size) is a key solution to this problem.  By amortizing the parameter read cost across more users, the memory bandwidth utilization improves significantly, bringing the compute and memory aspects into a more balanced relationship.   The examples of batch sizes 256 and 512 illustrate this point well, showing how the FLOPs per byte of memory read increase, aligning better with the H100's capabilities.       It seems you're discussing the tradeoffs involved in deploying large language models (LLMs) at scale. You've touched on several key factors:  * **Latency vs. Throughput:** Using more chips can reduce latency, but it increases communication overhead. * **Batch Size:** Larger batch sizes improve throughput and utilization, but can exacerbate memory limitations. * **Memory Capacity:**  LLMs require significant memory, and the need for KV cache for attention mechanisms further increases this demand. * **Sequence Length:** Longer sequences place a heavy burden on memory bandwidth and capacity.  The optimal configuration depends heavily on the specific application requirements. Real-time applications prioritize low latency, while offline tasks may focus on maximizing throughput and cost efficiency.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GPT-4_Architecture_Infrastructure.pdf"}

For instance:\n\n- In a research setting, experts might use larger batch sizes to get a more representative error metric, taking advantage of the computational resources available.\n- For applications with real-time requirements, such as some forms of natural language processing, experts might opt for smaller batch sizes to ensure quick response times without incurring significant computational delays.\n\nIn practice, experts often need to balance the computational cost, speed of inference, and the quality of the results when determining the appropriate batch size for their specific needs.", "output": "OpenAI regularly hits a batch size of 4k+ on their inference clusters, which means even with optimal load balancing between experts, the experts only have batch sizes of ~ 500.

Please provide me with the text you would like me to analyze.     This text describes the liquid cooling system of a computing system, likely a data center server.   It explains how the heat from components like GPUs and CPUs is transferred to a coolant, which is then circulated through a loop and cooled by a radiator or a heat exchanger.   The text also highlights that while the Bianca board is primarily liquid cooled, the front portion of the tray containing other components is air-cooled.    Finally, it mentions different liquid cooling form factors:  * L2A (liquid to air) * L2L (liquid to liquid) *  and a third form factor which is not listed.         This passage describes the details of two Data Center (DC) form factors, L2A and L2L, used in the deployment of Nvidia's GB200 platform.   Here are some key takeaways:  * **Cooling Technologies:**  Nvidia currently supports air cooling and Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) for GB200 deployments. Immersion cooling, while existing, is not yet mature enough for widespread adoption and lacks serviceability.   * **L2A and L2L Form Factors:** Both L2A and L2L utilize cold plates, CDMs, and QDs for cooling within the IT rack. The key difference lies in the heat rejection method:     * **L2A** (Rear Door Heat Exchanger or RDHx) uses air as the medium to reject heat from the Technology Cooling System (TCS) to the Cooling Rack/In-Rack CDU.     * **L2L** utilizes facility water as the medium to reject heat from the TCS to the Cooling Rack/In-Rack CDU.    Let me know if you have any other questions about this passage.   This text describes two different liquid cooling solutions for data centers: RDHx and Sidecar.   RDHx is a solution where the radiator, fans, and pump units are all located on the back of the IT rack.  Sidecar, on the other hand, uses a separate cooling rack for these components, allowing for more radiator space and thus higher cooling capacity.  The text also clarifies that some RDHx solutions are actually air-to-liquid (A2L) and not true liquid cooling as previously believed.    The cooling capacity of RDHx is limited to around 30kW-40kW, making it insufficient for larger server racks. Sidecar solutions, with capacities ranging from 70kW to 140kW, are better suited for handling the higher TDP of modern server racks like the NVL36 and NVL 72.      This text describes two different data center cooling solutions: L2A and L2L.   L2A uses air cooling, where the heat generated by the servers is dissipated into the data center air and removed by traditional air conditioners (CRAC/CRAH).  L2L uses liquid cooling, where a coolant circulates through the servers and then exchanges heat with a facility water system. While L2L is more efficient, it requires additional piping infrastructure to connect the servers to the CDU (Cooling Device Unit) and the CDU to the water system.   The text also mentions that both solutions still rely on CRAC/CRAH to some extent, as not all the heat is removed by the liquid cooling system in L2L.     Let me know if you have any other questions about these cooling solutions.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

In addition to the power consumption savings, the total usage effectiveness (TUE) also sees a significant improvement, decreasing by more than 15%. For example, while the TUE for air cooling typically hovers around  1.4 for hyperscalers (approximately  1.55 for neoclouds), the TUE drops to  1.15 for Liquid-to-Liquid (L2L) cooling systems. This is achieved by requiring fewer fans compared to air cooling systems and ensuring uninterrupted airflow into the data center, contributing to the enhanced energy efficiency of liquid cooling solutions.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

Ultimately, the decision on suppliers is made by end customers or OEMs based on their procurement strategies. For example, Tier-1 CSPs aim to procure from 1 or 2 suppliers for each liquid cooling component. At COMPUTEX 2024, over 80 liquid cooling suppliers showcased their liquid cooling solutions as well as production capacity. 5 of us from SemiAnalysis were there and had conversations with every firm. With some simple math on capacity number, this raised an oversupply concerns before the party even got going. From our supply chain checks, many suppliers claim they have capacity, but very few have been listed on the reference vendor list let alone winning any significant orders. On top of this, quality and track record of the supplier is considered the most important determinant in the procurement decision chain. Hence, each component has varying competitive landscape and qualification entry barrier depending on different level of reliability requirements and customers procurement strategies.http://git.enflame.cn/jingming.guo/archinfo/-/blob/main/GB200_Hardware_Architecture.pdf"}

As end customers value quality and wish to avoid system failure over prices for components which are an insignificant percentage of GB200 BOM. We believe there will be less competition and pricing pressure on these components. In other words, there are very little incentives for end customers to replace incumbent suppliers at the risk of leakage.  This is a detailed description of the supplier landscape and component considerations for a high-powered data center infrastructure, likely related to a specific product or platform like the GB 200.   Here's a breakdown of the key points:  * **Cold Plate & QD Suppliers:** The market resembles that of 3DVC, but with additional players like AVC, Cooler Masters, Delta, and Auras. QD suppliers are predominantly US/European with CPC, Parker Hannifin, Danfoss, and Staubli being key vendors. CPC's clean room factory highlights the specialized manufacturing needs of QDs. * **Supply Constraints:** There's a current shortage of QDs, potentially hindering GB200 shipments.  * **CDM & CDU Competition:**  CDM (likely a component related to liquid cooling distribution) and CDU (Cooling Distribution Unit) are expected to be more competitive due to lower barriers to entry in manufacturing. * **CDM Manufacturing:**  While soldering QDs onto manifolds for CDM is not technically complex, proper execution is crucial to prevent leaks. * **CDU Market Dynamics:** While individual components of CDUs (BPHE, RPU, etc.) are not difficult to manufacture, the market will likely favor established suppliers offering complete system integration, telemetry/monitoring, and robust servicing/maintenance capabilities. * **Power Delivery Network Evolution:**  With increasing TDP (Thermal Design Power) per rack from H100 4-node configurations to GB200 NVL72 racks, the power delivery network is shifting from node-level PSUs to centralized rack-level PSUs. This change reflects the higher power demands of modern data centers.   This information suggests a focus on liquid cooling solutions and advancements in power distribution for high-performance computing systems.   This text describes the power architecture of a data center called GB 200.   It details the following:  * **Power Efficiency:** GB200 is designed for greater power efficiency compared to conventional designs. This is achieved through centralized power supply units (PSUs), a shift from 12VDC to 48VDC architecture, and reduced oversizing and redundancy in the PSU design. * **Power Shelf Configuration:** GB200 racks have power shelves at the top and bottom, each housing six  5.5kW PSUs, resulting in a total of 33kW per power shelf. These shelves accept 346-480V AC and output 48/50V DC. * **Power Distribution:** Power from the shelves flows through busbars at the rear of the rack to the server trays.  A power distribution board (PDB) steps down the 48V DC to 12V and distributes it to the components within the tray, including the Bianca board and fans.  * **Component Powering:** The Bianca board receives 12V power from the PDB, while the fans are powered through the Bianca board using 8-pin Molex connectors. * **Supply Chain:**  The text mentions the supply chain for PDBs and voltage regulators (VRMs) on the Bianca board, highlighting the diversity of suppliers, with some companies like Alpha Omega having a share in the PDB market. The VRM market appears to be more concentrated with major players like Monolithic Power Systems, Renesas, and Infineon. * **BMC:** The text briefly describes the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), a specialized processor used for remote monitoring and management of the host systems.
