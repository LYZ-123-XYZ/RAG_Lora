(8) What strategies are various companies and businesses employing in response to the scarcity of high-end GPUs like the H100?
------------------------------------------------------------
The scarcity of high-end GPUs like the H100 has led to competitive strategies among companies and businesses. Notably, we know of over a dozen companies that are endeavoring to manufacture their own GPUs. This competition has prompted them to explore options such as cutting the supply chain and working directly with TSMC for  H 100s. Additionally, there are instances of these organizations holding inventory risks with TSMC, where they may have committed to more than TSMC can produce until  2024. This has led to a scenario where these companies are essentially putting money on the table with TSMC and risking potential losses if they cannot convert the inventory into finished goods.AI Capacity Constraints - CoWoS and HBM Supply Chain
